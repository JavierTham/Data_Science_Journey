# Data_Science_Journey
Documenting my journey into this wonderful and vast field of Data Science. :smile:

Data science is getting bigger and bigger, the more I look into it, the more things I discover. It's overwhelming, yet exhilarating. 
Fortunately, there are many resources one can find online to get them started. Most of them are great; However, I often find myself engulfed by all the available resources (information overload), which often hinders me from getting started on doing something because I can't stop looking into other interesting concepts.

Therefore, I wanted to start this repository to:
1. Consolidate all the things I've learnt (+ resources that helped)
2. Get myself to actually start doing instead of learning
3. To help/encourage anyone that sees this and who's experiencing the same thing as I am :grin:

The general consensus of the best way to learn data science is to DO data science. SO, let me start of my trying to implement a data science project.
